This is the 60% layout with split backspace and right shift used by u/merlin36, 
host of the [MechMerlin](www.youtube.com/mechmerlin) YouTube channel.

It is used on his

[MechanicalKeyboards.com FaceW](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/bfake)   

## Keymap Notes
- Highly influenced by the KBP V60 and WKL B.Face standard layouts
- Arrow toggle switch is the 1u key by right shift
