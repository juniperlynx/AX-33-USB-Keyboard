Buswerks' 4x12 Ortholinear Layout
============================
For use on Planck, Let's Split, and similar keyboards

### Layout Overview

- Main Layer
	- Enter is located on the Raise key (layer-tap)
	- Space Cadet shift keys
		- Lower + shift keys = Brackets[]
		- Raise + shift keys = Braces{}
	- The bottom left key is the Adjust modifier
	- Escape is in the traditional Caps Lock position
		- Holding down the escape key acts as LGUI (intended for macOS use)
- Lower
	- There is a numpad on the right hand (4, 5, and 6 are located under JKL/NEI/HTN)
	- Plus and minus keys are located to the right of the numpad
	- There are macOS desktop navigation keys and volume controls under the left hand

- Raise
	- Vim-style arrow keys
		- Below the arrow keys are home, end, pgup, and pgdn
	- Symbols are located on the right side of the keyboard, in a somewhat logical order
		- Symbols from the number row are in order, starting on the left pinky.
		- Equals and underscore are in easily accessible spots, since they're commonly used in programming
		- The ampersand is less common, so it's to the right of the equals symbol
		
- Adjust
	- Function keys are located along the top row (reset is moved to the Colemak 'R' position)
