/* This library is only valid for STM32 processors.
 * This library follows the convention of the AVR i2c_master library.
 * As a result addresses are expected to be already shifted (addr << 1).
 * I2CD1 is the default driver which corresponds to pins B6 and B7. This
 * can be changed.
 * Please ensure that HAL_USE_I2C is TRUE in the halconf.h file and that
 * STM32_I2C_USE_I2C1 is TRUE in the mcuconf.h file. Pins B6 and B7 are used
 * but using any other I2C pins should be trivial.
