# AX-33 Keyboard controller
This is a USB keyboard controller for the membrane key mechanism found in the Brother AX-33 Typewriter.

The design is based on the one described in Ruiqi Mao's [keyboard-pcb-guide](https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide) and uses Hasu's [component library](https://github.com/tmk/kicad_lib_tmk) and [footprint library](https://github.com/tmk/keyboard_parts.pretty).
